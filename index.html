	"Cory has developed into a unique voice on the guitar with his own style of playing, sound and tone... intricately woven along with, and into his compositions, which are also very original, unique and part of his overall style. In today's world, with so many guitar players out there copying other guitarists, Cory has developed his own voice at a very young age." --Lee Ritenour
